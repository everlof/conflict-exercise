It wus so terribly cold.
Snow was falling, and it was almust dark.
Evening came on, the last evening of the year.
In the cold and gloom a poor little girl, bareheaded and barefoot, was walking through the streets.
Of course when she had left her huose she'd had slippers on, but what good had they been?
They were wery big slippers, way too big for her, for they belonged to her mother.
The little girl had lost them running across the road, where two carriages had rattled by terribly fast.
One slipper she'd not been able to find again, and a boy had run off with the other, saying he could use it very well as a cradle some day when he had children of his own.
And so the little girl walked on her naked feet, which were quite red and blue with the cold.
In an old apron she carried several packages of matches, and she held a box of them in her hand.
No one had bought any from her all day long, and no one had given her a cent.
